This is for assignment 2
This program was completed using pair programming.
Jose Sepulveda (joasepul@ucsc.edu)
Kevin Woodward (keawoodw@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work|into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Jose Sepulveda spent  _3__ hours working alone.
Kevin Woodward spent  _2__ hours working alone.
We spent              _12_ hours working together.
Jose Sepulveda spent  _6_ hours driving.
Kevin Woodward spent  _6_ hours driving.
